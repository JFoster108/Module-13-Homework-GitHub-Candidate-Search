# Module-13-Homework-GitHub-Candidate-Search

## Description

This is an updated version of an existing GitHub candidate search application utilizing react and vite, where I completed the front end using TypeScript, and called the application's API so the user can find potential candidate's GitHub, and delete them if necessary. This is a homework assignement through the web development bootcamp sponsered by UNC Chapel Hill.
