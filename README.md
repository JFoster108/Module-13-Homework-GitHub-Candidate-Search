# Module-13-Homework-GitHub-Candidate-Search
 This is a candidate search application that calls the GitHub API and renders data in the browser. I completed the front end using TypeScript, called the application's API, and then deployed the entire application to Render. This is a homework assignment for the web development bootcamp sponsored by UNC Chapel Hill.
